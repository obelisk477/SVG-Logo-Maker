# SVG Logo Maker / Module 10

## Description

This is a simple command-line application that dynamically generates an SVG logo based on user input such as logo text, text color, shape, and shape color. This can be used to create a quick logo for a project with little input, rather than outsourcing the job & paying a graphic desinger
## Usage

To use the application, download the code from the repo found at https://github.com/obelisk477/SVG-Logo-Maker. Navigate to the same directory as the "index.js" file and, assuming you have Node installed, run the command "npm i". This will install the necessary packages and dependencies.

After that, to run the application, simply type "node index.js" in the command line and hit enter. You will be guided through a series of promps that will be used to build out the logo according to your specifications, and afterwards, if there are no erros, you will be informed -- "Generated logo.svg". This file will be placed in the 'examples' folder found in the root directory, and can be used in the desired project.
